                        Hello, I'm Erik Chavez. I am a determined, motivated, and strong-minded individual with strong problem-solving skills. I am currently pursuing a double major at a private university. I have gained valuable experience as a Technical Support Intern at my prior High School. I am also working on completing my first CompTIA certification, A+, and Security+.


                        Aside from pursuing my professional goals, I am deeply passionate about staying on top of cybersecurity advancements and news. I enjoy the opportunity to learn more about emerging technologies, and I am constantly seeking to enhance my knowledge and skills in this ever-evolving field of technology. During my leisure time, I enjoy coding and creating fun projects that help me solve problems I may encounter, which not only fuels my passion but also broadens my experience and expertise.

                        I am a skilled and versatile photographer with 3 years of experience capturing the essence of events and creating beautiful portraits and creative photography, I have a keen eye for detail and a unique ability to capture the essence of each subject and moment with skill and artistry.

                <h4>Technical Support Intern</h4>
                <p>
                    As an Advanced Technician in District 94, I played a crucial role in managing and overseeing the repair process for Chromebooks used by students and staff. Beyond diagnosing and fixing computer issues, I took on the responsibility of mentoring and instructing a group of 20 students, teaching them valuable problem-solving, troubleshooting, and computer repair skills.
                    By leveraging my expertise and experience, I facilitated group projects focused on repairing student Chromebooks, creating a collaborative and interactive learning environment. Through these projects, I not only addressed the technical problems but also imparted essential skills to the students, empowering them to become independent problem solvers.
                    In addition to my role as an advanced technician and mentor, I also managed the customer service desk, prioritizing customer satisfaction by employing cooperative decision-making skills. I ensured that both the customers and the District received the best possible experience, providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for computer repairs.
                    To optimize workflow and productivity, I actively rotated through assigned jobs, ensuring that the repair room operated at its most efficient peak. This approach enabled me to handle a diverse range of tasks while maintaining a high level of service and meeting the needs of the district.
                    Overall, my advanced technician role involved not only diagnosing and repairing computers but also leading and teaching a group of students, instilling in them problem-solving abilities, troubleshooting skills, and computer repair knowledge. By doing so, I made a significant impact on the educational experience of both the students and the district as a whole.
